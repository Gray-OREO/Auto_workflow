# Auto_workflow
It's a simple but useful python script for repetitive experiments. You can changes the relative parameters for a customized auto-workflow for your work.
And it's the better way to run it after you copy the file into your work directory.
## How to run?
Typing the code `python work_flow.py` in your terminal.
## What's the output?
You can see two txt files in current directory, `tmp.txt` and `log.txt`. The single program output will be written in `tmp.txt`, and the key items (like the final text result) will be appended in `log.txt` for the whole workflow.  
The immediate progress and rest time will be printed in terminal.
`Progress 3/20
It takes 13 mins
Estimated remaining time: 225.0 mins.`
